update IP, with resets
debugging everything inside : 
U1_plasma, 
u1_cpu, - Removed u1_cpu, was too many
u1_pc_next, 
u2_mem_ctrl.
in total 3800 bits to probe. was too much, paritioned in
ila_0: 666 probes
ila_1: 1 probe but 883 bits
ila_2: probe1: 371, probe2: 1736 
CPD file generation failed. fucked up. restarted
==============================
created new IP. where on node 0, ram_xilinx_0 is used. because, when i saw the diffs of ram files, 3 was different than others.
added everythin inside UART. and every IO port of UART - from outside. infact, they're same. but still.
didn't fit. removed external. 
terminated because:
==============================
old instructions were running. now fixed. lets see
implementing normal version without debuggers.
didn't work with usb. neither with analyzer.
UART WORKS. FUCKING REG BANK WAS COMMENTED. REGENERATED IP, LETS SEE.
==============================
