WARNING: [Place 30-879] Found overlapping PBlocks. The use of overlapping PBlocks is not recommended as it may lead to legalization errors or unplaced instances.
ERROR: [Place 30-640] Place Check : This design requires more LUT as Memory cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 33028 of such cell types but only 17400 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device. Please set tcl parameter "drc.disableLUTOverUtilError" to 1 to change this error to warning.
