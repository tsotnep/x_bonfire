debugging all uart signals. ALL
result was, only write_enable was working. that was: 1000000101000000101001 something like that. 
that means:

in Plasma: 
	write_enable <= '1' when cpu_byte_we /= "0000" else '0';
	enable_uart_read <= enable_uart and not write_enable;
	enable_uart_write <= enable_uart and write_enable;

in plasma, uart inst:
	enable_write => enable_uart_write,

terminated because:
==============================
old instructions were running. now fixed. lets see
added debug to all uarts.
failed because of this:
*****************
	[Place 30-484] The packing of lutram instances into lutram capable slices could not be obeyed. 

		Number of LUTRAMs: 6580
		Number of LUTRAM capable slices required is 4005 out of 4350 in the device (utilization 92.069%)

	Even though there is a sufficient number of LUTRAM capable slices in the device, the packing algorithm was not able to find a solution. Please analyze your design to determine if the number of LUTRAMs can be reduced.

	As a result, 1 LUTRAMs failed to place.
	Names of these LUTRAMs:
	u_ila_0/inst/ila_core_inst/u_trig/N_DDR_TC.N_DDR_TC_INST[2].U_TC/allx_typeA_match_detection.ltlib_v1_0_0_allx_typeA_inst/DUT/u_srl_drive type SRLC32E

	None of mentioned LUTRAMs is from any Pblock.

	Resolution: Please analyze your design to determine if the number of lutrams can be reduced by combining multiple lutrams into Block RAMs for example.

UART WORKS. FUCKING REG BANK WAS COMMENTED. REGENERATED IP, LETS SEE.
