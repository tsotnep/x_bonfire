three folders: 

node - NoC_Node implementation, single PLASMA.

nocnet_proj - 2x2 network custom IP core (has four nodes)

noc_jtag_proj - project that was "implemented", has 2x2network and jtag-debug and all necessary perihperials to be fully functional. except the fact that it does not have most of the internals, because i didn't knew and wasn't told that xilinx brams are commented.
