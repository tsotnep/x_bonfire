in folder "disabled" - i have reports for designs where reg_bank.vhd is DISABLED. in other words, in this versions xilinx memory generation was commented.

in folder "enabled" i have reports for designs where reg_bank.vhd is ENABLED, i uncommented xilinx memory generation. 

the difference is so huge, because, since those 16 registers of cpu was not created, they made rest of the circuit unused, and then, synthesis tool optimized them out.







**********block_vs_distributed_ram

block ram::: memory tiles

ditributed ram::: memory made out of LUTs.  - we have too much of those
